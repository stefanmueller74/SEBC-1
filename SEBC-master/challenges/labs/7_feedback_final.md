### Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
It was both - very useful but also very diffcult (for me as I'm not an expert on linux/shell level).

### Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?

* Most familiar: everything around databases, general concept of an hadoop system
* Leat familiar: KERBEROS (I skipped the whole labs because I had absolutely no experience with that), Network configuration 

### Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?

All of the topics very interesting and helpful.
In general i like these types of demanding hands-on-training - they give you a really good idea what's relevant and where some crucial pitfalls might be.

### How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?

My current role as a Head of Big Data @ ADVISORI is not intended to actually build / maintain a cluster by myself.
But if I had to I would have a long was to go in these areas:
* Network configuration
* Disk configuration / mounting
* Orchestration of the various components (Oozie, Zookeeper)

# General Comment

A really great course with lot of great resources and knowledgde!

But the content was way too much for doing both at the same time: listening to the trainers and setting up the cluster handson to cover up the misssed / unfinished labs.

Recommendation: either stripping down the handson-labs a bit AND/OR providing a litte bit more "step by step"-Documentation so that the people actually do the stuff hands-on but maybe saving some time by less need for research/trial and error.

But I would definitely recommend the course (for experienced colleagues :)).
